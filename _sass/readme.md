## \_sass

The scss-file in this folder determines the style-properties of the website. The original file from the Cayman-theme is overwritten to make the header as well as its buttons smaller, and to add functionality to the buttons. The file that was overwritten can be seen here: https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman/blob/master/_sass/jekyll-theme-cayman.scss
