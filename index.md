## Conceptuccino

Concepts, as a subject of discussion since antiquity, are central to human cognition and therefore a core topic of cognitive science and essential to our understanding of the human mind. In the past decades, research on concepts has been carried out in a variety of fields (ranging from psychology over linguistics to artificial intelligence) and from a variety of perspectives. However, most of this research has been conducted independently or between a restricted selection of neighboring disciplines. In order to arrive at a more holistic understanding of concepts, it is crucial to have a higher awareness and familiarity with approaches from other disciplines. The current situation therefore calls for a broader education of young researchers that also encompasses related fields of study.

**Conceptuccino** used to be the name of an informal reading group on concepts at the [Institute of Cognitive Science](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/home.html). Taking it from there, we aim to establish this website as a platform for all interested concept researchers. This website features links to relevant [research projects](concept_research/research_projects.md) and [publications](concept_research/literature.md), an interdisciplinary mailing list, and a series of workshops.
