## CARLA 2020

The first international workshop “Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Application” took place at the 
[Institute of Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.uni-osnabrueck.de/) at Osnabrück University in 2018. Following its great success, we are organizing 
a second international workshop “Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Application” (CARLA) in 2020. We invite the submission of extended
abstracts to the workshop for oral or poster presentations.

### Time and Venue:

September 22 and September 23, 2020, VIRTUAL, as part of the [Bolzano Summer of Knowledge](https://summerofknowledge.inf.unibz.it/) (BOSK). You can 
register for free for participation in all BOSK events under the following link: https://summerofknowledge.inf.unibz.it/registration/

**IMPORTANT:** CARLA 2020 will be conducted as a virtual workshop on the originally planned dates. More information about how to attend will follow.

### Invited Talks:

[Marianna Bolognesi](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/m.bolognesi/en), University of Bologna, Bologna (Italy): **Two dimensions of conceptual 
representation: concreteness and specificity**

Conceptual concreteness and categorical specificity are two continuous variables that allow distinguishing, for example, justice (low concreteness) 
from banana (high concreteness) and furniture (low specificity) from rocking chair (high specificity). The relation between these two variables is 
unclear, with some scholars suggesting that they might be highly correlated.  Moreover, while cognitive scientists are typically interested in 
investigating conceptual concreteness and understanding how abstract and concrete concepts are learned, processed and represented in mind, computer 
scientists and computational linguists are typically interested in the processes of categorical abstraction and thus in the variable hereby called 
categorical specificity.  
In this talk I discuss the relation between the two variables showing empirical data that suggests that the two variables are two distinct dimensions 
of the general phenomenon called abstraction.

[Mattis List](https://www.shh.mpg.de/person/51419/2375), Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Jena (Germany): **Representing 
concepts for the purpose of cross-linguistic language comparison**

While it is obvious that words in human languages denote concepts, it is much less obvious how the concepts that words denote can be compared across
languages. Since many linguists are very skeptical if a systematic comparison of concepts is possible at all, approaches that use concepts as a tertium
comparationis for the purpose of cross-linguistic investigations are rather rare. This is a pity, since the concept-based perspective on language 
comparison offers many fascinating possibilities that go far beyond the classical enterprise of historical language comparison (which seeks to classify
languages with respect to their genetic affiliation). When working with concept-based approaches to cross-linguistic language comparison, the concrete
operationalization (or representation) of concepts is of great importance.  
In the talk, I will present our recent attempts to operationalize concepts in a rather pragmatic fashion as part of the Concepticon 
(https://concepticon.clld.org) project, and how we use them for the creation of huge cross-linguistic lexical datasets in the CLICS project 
(https://clics.clld.org). Apart from discussing the background of the projects, their major goals, and the problems we encounter, I will also illustrate
how the cross-linguistic data which we aggregated so far can be used to investigate concrete research questions, focusing on the learning and the 
application of concepts.

### Call for Abstracts:

"Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Application" (CARLA) is an international workshop aimed at fostering interdisciplinary exchange about
research on concepts. It invites contributions from all fields related to cognitive science, including (but not limited to) linguistics, artificial 
intelligence, psychology, philosophy, logic, and computer science. Although the workshop is open for research on any aspect of concepts, there exists a 
set of core topics that are of special interest:
- **Representation:** _How can we formally describe and model concepts?_
- **Learning:** _Where do concepts come from and how are they acquired?_
- **Application:** _How are concepts used in cognitive tasks?_

This workshop provides an excellent opportunity to present and discuss ongoing research on concepts. We invite concept researchers from all fields related
to cognitive science to submit abstracts to the workshop for oral or poster presentations.

### Submission and Publication:

We invite the submission of extended abstracts via until **April 30, 2020**. We will send out acceptance notifications by May 31, 2020.

The extended abstracts can use up to three pages (including references) and should be uploaded as pdf based on the following template (LaTeX or Word) which
is based on Springer’s LNCS style: Download Template

For both submission and publication of the accepted abstracts, we use OpenReview.net: Link

### Presentations:

There will be two types of presentations at the workshop:
- **Invited talks** consist of a 45 minute presentation and a 15 minute discussion.
- **Regular talks** consist of a 30 minute presentation and a 10 minute discussion.

### Registration:

We take part in the general registration procedure of the Bolzano Summer of Knowledge. Attending the CARLA workshop is for free, but registration is 
mandatory to receive the login information for the videoconference. Please register by the end of August (i.e., 31.08.2020) via the official registration
site. We will provide the login information to all registered participants about one week before the workshop.
