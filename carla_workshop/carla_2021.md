## CARLA 2021

### CARLA 2021 goes fully virtual: The workshop will be conducted in a fully virtual way without any attendance fees. 

The first international workshop “Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Application” took place at the Institute of Cognitive Science
at Osnabrück University in 2018, followed by a virtual event as part of the Bolzano Summer of Knowledge (BOSK) in 2020. Following its great success,
we are organizing a third international workshop “Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Application” (CARLA) in 2021. We invite the submission
of abstracts to the workshop.

### Time and Venue:

**Date:** 16.09.2021 - 17.09.2021  
**Venue:** Virtual, co-located with FOIS 2021 (13.09.2021 - 16.09.2021) and ICCS 2021 (20.09.2021 - 23.09.2021), as part of the Bolzano Summer of Knowledge
(BOSK) 2021.

**IMPORTANT:** CARLA 2021will be conducted as a **fully virtual** event without any attendance fees. More information about how to attend can be found below.

### Invited Talks:

Monique Flecken, Department of Linguistics, University of Amsterdam

**Events in Language and Cognition**  
Event cognition is an important part of our mental capacity: Perceiving, describing and memorizing the events (e.g., reading a book, chopping an onion)
happening in the world around us is fundamental to our everyday lives. Given that events can be described in different ways both within one and the same
language, and across different languages, I ask, to what extent linguistic variation may guide or shape our event cognition. I will present psycholinguistic
studies that investigate how people conceptualize, perceive and memorize events of different types, with the aim of shedding light on the relation between
language and (event) cognition.

Antonio Lieto, Department of Computer Science, University Turin

**Heterogeneous Proxytypes as a Unifying Cognitive Framework for Conceptual Representation and Reasoning in Artificial Systems**  
This talk presents the heterogeneous proxytypes hypothesis as a cognitively-inspired computational framework able to reconcile, in both natural and 
artificial systems, different theories of typicality about conceptual representation and reasoning that have been traditionally seen as incompatible.
In particular, by exploiting the Dual PECCS system and its evolution, it shows how prototypes, exemplars, and "theory theory"-like conceptual representations
can be integrated in a cognitive artificial agent thus providing both an extension of its categorization capabilities and useful insights in the context of a
computationally grounded science of the mind.

### Call for Abstracts:

"Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Application" (CARLA) is an international workshop aimed at fostering interdisciplinary exchange about 
research on concepts. It invites contributions from all fields related to cognitive science, including (but not limited to) linguistics, artificial intelligence,
psychology, philosophy, logic, and computer science.

The workshop is open for research on any aspect of concepts, but there are three overarching topics that are of special interest with the following (not 
exhaustive) list of exemplary subtopics:

- **Representation:** _How can we formally describe and model concepts?_
    - Conceptual Spaces, Conceptual Domains, Frames
    - Lexical Semantics and Pragmatics
    - Grounded Cognition, Embodiment, 4E Cognition
- **Learning:** _Where do concepts come from and how are they acquired?_
    - Evolution of Concepts
    - Cross-Cultural and Social Aspects of Concepts
    - Developmental Psychology of Concepts
- **Application:** _How are concepts used in cognitive tasks?_
    - Event Cognition
    - Artificial Agents
    - Concept Blending, Metaphors, Creativity

This workshop provides an excellent opportunity to present and discuss ongoing research on concepts, both from theoretical/formal and applied/experimental
viewpoints. We invite concept researchers from all fields related to cognitive science to submit abstracts to the workshop.

### Submission and Publication (Extended Deadline!):

We invite the submission of abstracts via EasyChair until May 26, 2021. Acceptance notifications will be sent out by June 16, 2021.

The abstracts should use two to three pages (including references) and should be uploaded as pdf based on the following template (LaTeX or Word)
which is based on Springer’s LNCS style: Download Template

We will use the following EasyChair instance to collect and review the submissions: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=carla2021

Depending on the number and quality of the received submissions, selected contributions may be published after the workshop. More information on this
will follow.

### Preliminary Schedule:

We have three types of talks:  
- Keynote Talks consist of a 40 minute presentation, followed by 20 minutes Q&A.
- Oral presentations consist of a 20-25 minute presentation and 10-15 minutes Q&A.
- Poster sessions contain 6 posters each. In the beginning, each poster is presented in a short pitch (up to five minutes; 20-25 minutes total).
Afterwards, we have a parallel Q&A session (35-40 minutes), where each poster is discussed in a separate breakout room.
