## CARLA Workshop Series

**"Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Application"** is a workshop series aimed at fostering interdisciplinary exchange about research on concepts. It invites contributions from all fields related to Cognitive Science, including but not limited to Linguistics, Artificial Intelligence, Psychology, and Computer Science.

Although the workshop series is open for research on any aspect of concepts, there exists a set of core topics that are of special interest:

- **Representation:** _"How can we formally describe and model concepts?"_
- **Learning:** _"Where do concepts come from and how are they acquired?"_
- **Application:** _"How are concepts used in cognitive tasks?"_
