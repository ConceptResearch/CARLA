The [Institute of Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.uni-osnabrueck.de/) at Osnabrück University is happy to announce the international workshop 
“Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Application”. We invite the submission of extended abstracts to the workshop for oral or poster

### Call for Abstracts:

"Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Application" (CARLA) is an international workshop aimed at fostering interdisciplinary exchange about
research on concepts. It invites contributions from all fields related to cognitive science, including (but not limited to) linguistics, artificial 
intelligence, psychology, philosophy, logic, and computer science. Although the workshop is open for research on any aspect of concepts, there exists a 
set of core topics that are of special interest:
- **Representation:** _How can we formally describe and model concepts?_
- **Learning:** _Where do concepts come from and how are they acquired?_
- **Application:** _How are concepts used in cognitive tasks?_

We invite the submission of extended abstracts (up to 500 words excluding references) to https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=carlaws18 until May 20,
2018. We will send out acceptance notifications by May 31, 2018.

### Publication:

We plan to invite a selection of presentations for publication after the workshop.

### Presentations:

There are three types of presentations:
- Invited talks consist of 45 minutes for the talk itself plus 15 minutes for questions and discussions.
- Oral presentations consist of 20 minutes for the talk itself plus 10 minutes for questions and discussions. Presenters can use their own laptop if 
they like.
- Poster presentations take place during the poster session. Posters should be of size A0 (portrait orientation only) or A1 (portrait or landscape
orientation). At the beginning of the poster session, authors are invited to give a 2 minute "elevator pitch" on their poster. They can use a single
slide for illustrations. This single slide should be emailed to [concepts@uni-osnabrueck.de](mailto:concepts@uni-osnabrueck.de) as pdf file until Friday, 10.08.2018, 2 pm sharp.
