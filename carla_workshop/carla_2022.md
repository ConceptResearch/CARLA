# CARLA 2022

[comment]: <> ( ### CARLA 2022 goes fully virtual: The workshop will be conducted in a fully virtual way without any attendance fees. )

The first workshop “Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Application” took place at the Institute of Cognitive Science at Osnabrück University in 2018, followed by two virtual events as part of the Bolzano Summer of Knowledge (BOSK) in 2020 and 2021. Currently, we are organizing a fourth (potentially hybrid) workshop “Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Application” (CARLA) in 2022. In addition to a general main session, CARLA 2022 will feature a special session on concepts and register, in relation to the Collaborative Research Center [CRC1412](https://sfb1412.hu-berlin.de/) "Register" at the Humboldt University of Berlin.

## Time and Venue:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Date:** 22-24. August 2022  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Venue:** Dorotheenstr. 24, 10117 Berlin, Room 1.101/1.102/1.103<br/>

## Call for Abstracts:

"Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Application" (CARLA) is an international workshop aimed at fostering interdisciplinary exchange about research on concepts. It invites contributions from all fields related to cognitive science, including (but not limited to) linguistics, artificial intelligence, psychology, philosophy, logic, computer science.

The workshop is open for research on any aspect of concepts, but there are three overarching topics that are of special interest with the following (not exhaustive) list of exemplary subtopics:

- **Representation:** _How can we formally describe and model concepts?_
    - Conceptual Spaces, Conceptual Domains, Frames
    - Lexical Semantics and Pragmatics
    - Grounded Cognition, Embodiment, 4E Cognition
- **Learning:** _Where do concepts come from and how are they acquired?_
    - Evolution of Concepts
    - Cross-Cultural and Social Aspects of Concepts
    - Developmental Psychology of Concepts
- **Application:** _How are concepts used in cognitive tasks?_
    - Event Cognition
    - Artificial Agents
    - Concept Blending, Metaphors, Creativity
    
This workshop aims to provide an excellent opportunity to present and discuss ongoing research on concepts, both from theoretical/formal and applied/experimental viewpoints. We invite concept researchers from all related fields to submit abstracts to the workshop.

### Topics of the special session:

In addition to the general main session on concepts, we would like to draw attention to our special session from researchers working at the interfaces between linguistics, sociolinguistics, anthropology, and sociology. This special session will focus on concepts and registers, in relation to the [CRC1412](https://sfb1412.hu-berlin.de/) “Register”. Registers as socially recurring intra-individual (and inter-individual) variation represent concepts influenced by situational and functional settings, such as the formality of the context of use and social relation of interlocutors. This special session is open to research on any aspects of concepts in relation to registers, and in particular, to research on register sensitivity of conceptual (lexical semantic and pragmatic) knowledge. Subtopics include but are not restricted to: (1) Documentation, description, and formal analyses of register-sensitivity of concepts; (2) Semantics and pragmatics of socially-rich concepts such as "gender" (biological, social, psychological) and "social status"; (3) Formal definitions and (e.g. probabilistic) analyses of theoretical concepts and notions in register research, such as "formality"; (4) Empirical investigations of these matters using corpus-linguistic, fieldwork, computational or experimental methods.




## Submission and Publication:

We invite the submission of abstracts via EasyChair until **May 22, 2022**. Acceptance notifications will be sent out by June 15, 2022.
