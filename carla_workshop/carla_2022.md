[comment]: <> ( ### CARLA 2022 goes fully virtual: The workshop will be conducted in a fully virtual way without any attendance fees. )

The first international workshop “Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Application” took place at the Institute of Cognitive Science at Osnabrück University in 2018, followed by two virtual events as part of the Bolzano Summer of Knowledge (BOSK) in 2020 and 2021. Following its great success, we are organizing a fourth hybrid workshop “Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Application” (CARLA) in 2022. In addition to a general main seesion, CARLA 2022 will feature a special session concepts and register, in relation to the Collaborative Research Center [CRC1412](https://sfb1412.hu-berlin.de/) on "Register" at the Humboldt University of Berlin.

## Call for Abstracts:

"Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Application" (CARLA) is an international workshop aimed at fostering interdisciplinary exchange about research on concepts. It invites contributions from all fields related to cognitive science, including (but not limited to) linguistics, artificial intelligence, psychology, philosophy, logic, computer science.

The workshop is open for research on any aspect of concepts, but there are three overarching topics that are of special interest with the following (not exhaustive) list of exemplary subtopics:

- **Representation:** _How can we formally describe and model concepts?_
    - Conceptual Spaces, Conceptual Domains, Frames
    - Lexical Semantics and Pragmatics
    - Grounded Cognition, Embodiment, 4E Cognition
- **Learning:** _Where do concepts come from and how are they acquired?_
    - Evolution of Concepts
    - Cross-Cultural and Social Aspects of Concepts
    - Developmental Psychology of Concepts
- **Application:** _How are concepts used in cognitive tasks?_
    - Event Cognition
    - Artificial Agents
    - Concept Blending, Metaphors, Creativity

In relation to the Collaborative Research Center CRC1412 on "Register" at the Humboldt University of Berlin, we focuse in the special session on topics related to the field of sociolinguistics and variation:

 - **Registers:** _How are concepts register sensitive?_

This workshop provides an excellent opportunity to present and discuss ongoing research on concepts, both from theoretical/formal and applied/experimental viewpoints. We invite concept researchers from all fields related to cognitive science to submit abstracts to the workshop.
