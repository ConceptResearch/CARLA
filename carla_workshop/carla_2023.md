# CARLA 2023
[comment]: <> ( ### CARLA 2023 goes fully in-person.)

The first workshop “Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Applications” took place at the Institute of Cognitive Science at Osnabrück University in 2018, followed by two virtual events as part of the Bolzano Summer of Knowledge (BOSK) in 2020, 2021, and a hybrid event at the Humboldt University of Berlin in 2022.

## Call for Abstracts:

"Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Applications" (CARLA) is an international workshop that fosters interdisciplinary exchanges about research on concepts. We invite contributions from all fields within cognitive science, including linguistics, psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, and computer science.

The workshop is open for research on any aspect of concepts and semantics, with three overarching topics, addressing the following (non-exhaustive) list of questions:

- **Representation:** 
    - What is the nature of semantic/conceptual representation?
    - How are concepts processed in the brain?
    - How do concepts compose to form complex thoughts?
    - How can we formally describe and model concepts?
- **Learning:**
    - What is the ontology of concepts and how do they develop?
    - How do we learn to categorize objects and events?
    - What kind of cognitive architecture supports concept acquisition and development?
- **Applications:**
    - How concepts are used in cognitive tasks and in applied cognitive systems, such as:
        - Applied machine learning in computer vision
        - Decision making
        - Category learning
    
This workshop aims to provide an excellent opportunity to present and discuss ongoing research on concepts, both from theoretical/formal and applied/experimental viewpoints. We invite concept researchers from all related fields to submit abstracts to the workshop.

**Abstract Submission:** 
<h> We invite the submission of abstracts via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=carla2022 </h>

Papers should be submitted in PDF format. Please send two attachments: (1) one with title, author(s), affiliation, text, and references; and (2) another with the title and text only (there should be no authorship information). Review of abstracts will be based on the anonymized submissions. Abstracts are limited to 1000 words (up to two pages). Graphs or diagrams can be included in the two-page limit. Authors of accepted papers will have the opportunity to revise the abstract before publication in the abstract booklet.

The deadline for submissions is **July 1st, 2023 (at 11:59 pm, any time zone).**
