# CARLA 2023
[comment]: <> ( ### CARLA 2023 goes fully in-person.)

The first workshop “Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Applications” took place at the Institute of Cognitive Science at Osnabrück University in 2018, followed by two virtual events as part of the Bolzano Summer of Knowledge (BOSK) in 2020, 2021, and a hybrid event at the Humboldt University of Berlin in 2022. 

The <a href="https://psycholinguistics.weebly.com">Psycholinguistics and Cognition Lab</a> of the Department of Psychology, Concordia University, Montreal, will be hosting the 5th edition of the CARLA workshop, to be held on August 23-25 (Wed-Fri), 2023, in Montreal.

## Call for Abstracts:

"Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Applications" (CARLA) is an international workshop that fosters interdisciplinary exchanges about research on concepts. We invite contributions from all fields within cognitive science, including linguistics, psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, and computer science.

The workshop is open for research on any aspect of concepts and semantics, with three overarching topics, addressing the following (non-exhaustive) list of questions:

- **Representation:** 
    - What is the nature of semantic/conceptual representation?
    - How are concepts processed in the brain?
    - How do concepts compose to form complex thoughts?
    - How can we formally describe and model concepts?
- **Learning:**
    - What is the ontology of concepts and how do they develop?
    - How do we learn to categorize objects and events?
    - What kind of cognitive architecture supports concept acquisition and development?
- **Applications:**
    - How concepts are used in cognitive tasks and in applied cognitive systems, such as:
        - Applied machine learning in computer vision
        - Decision making
        - Category learning
    
This workshop aims to provide an excellent opportunity to present and discuss ongoing research on concepts, both from theoretical/formal and applied/experimental viewpoints. We invite concept researchers from all related fields to submit abstracts to the workshop.

- **Local Organizers:** :
- Roberto G. de Almeida [Psychology, Concordia University]
- Christopher Genovesi [Psychology, Concordia University]
- Tobias Ungerer [Psychology, Concordia University]
- Caitlyn Antal [Psychology, McGill University]

This workshop is sponsored by the following Concordia University Departments and Institutes: Department of Psychology, Centre for Cognitive Science and Linguistics, Applied AI Institute, Department of Philosophy, and and the Department of Classics, Modern Languages, and Linguistics.
