# CARLA 2023
[comment]: <> ( ### CARLA 2023 goes fully in-person.)

The first workshop “Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Applications” took place at the Institute of Cognitive Science at Osnabrück University in 2018, followed by two virtual events as part of the Bolzano Summer of Knowledge (BOSK) in 2020, 2021, and a hybrid event at the Humboldt University of Berlin in 2022. 

The <a href="https://psycholinguistics.weebly.com">Psycholinguistics and Cognition Lab</a> of the Department of Psychology, Concordia University, Montreal, will be hosting the 5th edition of the CARLA workshop, to be held on August 23-25 (Wed-Fri), 2023, in Montreal.

## Call for Abstracts:

"Concepts in Action: Representation, Learning, and Applications" (CARLA) is an international workshop aimed at fostering interdisciplinary exchange about research on concepts. It invites contributions from all fields related to cognitive science, including (but not limited to) linguistics, artificial intelligence, psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience.

The workshop is open for research on any aspect of concepts, but there are three overarching topics that are of special interest with the following (not exhaustive) list of exemplary subtopics:

- **Representation:** _How can we formally describe and model concepts?_
    - Conceptual Spaces, Conceptual Domains, Frames
    - Lexical Semantics and Pragmatics
    - Grounded Cognition, Embodiment, 4E Cognition
- **Learning:** _Where do concepts come from and how are they acquired?_
    - Evolution of Concepts
    - Cross-Cultural and Social Aspects of Concepts
    - Developmental Psychology of Concepts
- **Applications:** _How are concepts used in cognitive tasks by humans and artificial systems?_
    - Vision-Language Interface
    - Deep Learning
    - Event Cognition
    - Artificial Agents
    - Concept Blending, Metaphors, Creativity
    
This workshop aims to provide an excellent opportunity to present and discuss ongoing research on concepts, both from theoretical/formal and applied/experimental viewpoints. We invite concept researchers from all related fields to submit abstracts to the workshop.

This workshop is sponsored by the following Concordia University Departments and Institutes: Department of Psychology, Centre for Cognitive Science and Linguistics, Applied AI Institute, Department of Philosophy, and and the Department of Classics, Modern Languages, and Linguistics.
